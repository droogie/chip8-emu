# Chip-8 Emulator

This is a Chip-8 emulator written in Rust and using SDL2 for audio and video. This is a hobby project to get more experience in the world of emulation, while learning a new programming language. The emulators current state appears to be accurate and passes various Chip-8 test roms.
